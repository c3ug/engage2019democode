# engage2019democode
Demo Code from Graham's and Heiko's Demo at Engage!2019 in Brussels

Code is provicded "as-is", no garantee that it will run on your system.

Please check the code - there are five parts of ocde here (API, Survey frontend, socket-io-server and client and the ODP for the Notes App.) - they have to be configured properly to work hand in hand - please check the code for urls, endpoints and certs, etc.
